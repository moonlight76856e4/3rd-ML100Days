    "\n",
    "    (1) Sampling N samples with replacement from a size N dataset. Since the method is with replacement, each sampling gets different data.\n",
    "    (2) Train different functions on different sampling data, then average or voting their outputs to decide the best predict outcome.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note1: bagging is used when the model is complex, the variance is large, and is easy to overfit, eg. decision tree.\n",
    "    Note2: bagging is parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (1) Obtain the first classifier.\n",
    "    (2) Find another function, which is complementary with the first classifier, to help the first classifier.\n",
    "    (3) Repeat step (2) until ...\n",
    "    (4) Combining all the classifiers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note1: boosting is used when the model is weak, and cannot fit the data.\n",
    "    Note2: boosting is sequentially\n",
