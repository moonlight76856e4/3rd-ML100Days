    "The probability of a sample being selected is (1/N), so the probability of a sample not being selected is (1-1/N). Since every sample being selected is independent, the sample not being selected everytime is ((1-1/N) X N), which can be approximately calculated as 1/e, or 0.368. Thus, the data is composed of 63.2% of raw data."
